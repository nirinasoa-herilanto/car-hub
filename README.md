# Car showcase

Car showcase is a project created by JSMastery, by using the new features of `Next JS 13` with the app directory.

I saw this project on [JSMastery Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU), and I'd like to improve my understanding of `Next JS 13`, and re-create this project with my own coding styles.

# Getting started

After cloning the repository, and installing all dependencies of the applications.

We can launched the app by doing this command on our terminal, then open the browser with [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (local development)

```
npm run dev
```

# Deployment

The project is available on this [link](https://nhr-carhub.vercel.app/)
